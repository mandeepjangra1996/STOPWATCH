# Alarm Clock - Vanilla JavaScript [Stopwatch]

HTML Structure:

The HTML code defines the structure of the stopwatch webpage.
It includes the necessary elements for displaying the time and buttons.
The id attributes are used to uniquely identify elements for JavaScript manipulation.
CSS Styling:

The CSS code styles the visual appearance of the webpage.
It sets the background color, font styles, and positions the elements on the page.
JavaScript Logic:

The JavaScript code provides the functionality for the stopwatch.
It initializes variables to keep track of hours, minutes, seconds, and counts.
The timer variable is used to control whether the stopwatch is running or not.
There are three functions defined: start(), stop(), and reset().
The start() function sets the timer to true and calls the stopwatch() function to start the timer.
The stop() function sets the timer to false, effectively stopping the timer.
The reset() function sets all time-related variables to zero and resets the displayed values.
The stopwatch() function is the core of the stopwatch logic.
If the timer is true, it increments the count by 1.
When count reaches 99, it increments sec by 1 and resets count to 0.
Similar logic is applied to handle minute and hour increments.
The displayed values are updated with leading zeros when necessary.
The setTimeout() function is used to repeatedly call the stopwatch() function every 10 milliseconds while the timer is active.
